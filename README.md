## Hello World!

I am a 22 year old, mostly self taught, software engineer born in Morocco and currently living in France. I'm passionate about sofware engineering, robotics, and everything in-between. I've worked with tools ranging from PHP / Laravel, JS/TS, Python, C++ and most web Frontend Technologies (VueJs, React ...) . I love to learn and contribute in any and every possible way.
