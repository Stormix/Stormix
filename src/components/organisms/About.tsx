          I started web development when I was 14 and my first project was a music website where I hosted some music
          projects I made with a friend mine. (Stormix was my <i>&quot;artist&quot;</i> name)

          Fast-forward a few years, I became obsessed with web development, and started my journey as a freelance
          software developer. Since then, I&quot;ve been assisting clients all over the globe in making their concepts a
          reality.

          I moved to France {since}, to pursue an engineering degree in both software engineering and robotics at{' '}

          applications. In addition, I worked part time as a freelance developer for the school&apos;s{' '}

          During my internships and my last year, I started a full-time job working as the lead developer for a Belgian

          . And in few months, we managed to build a full class booking and video on demand platform, along with mobile
          apps for both iOS and Android. I handled the entire development process, from the initial design
          implementation to the deployment of the final product.
